# Welcome to Dev Training Sessions

#### Goals 
A shared platform to request and document training topics to assist our internal team members in providing how-to's to our customers and user base.

#### Topic Requests
To submit a topic request, click the _Exclamation Point icon on the right_ to create an Issue. Name the issue simply and explicitly so other team members can easily find and review topics at a later date. 

#### Session Agendas
Session agenda information and history will be documented in the _WIKI_ by session date.
