# Welcome to Dev Training Sessions

#### Goals 
A shared platform to request and document training topics to assist our internal team members in providing how-to's to our customers and user base.

#### Topic Requests
To submit a topic request, click the Exclamation Point icon on the right to create an Issue. Name the issue simply and explicitly so other team members can easily find and review topics at a later date. 

#### Session Agendas
Session agenda information and history will be documented in the WIKI by session date.
